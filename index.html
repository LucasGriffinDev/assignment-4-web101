        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Located off the main street, Bruno's Pizzeria has been the heart and
          soul of the neighborhood. For years, the aroma of our freshly baked
          pizzas has wafted through the streets, bringing joy to every corner.
          While we're traditional at heart, we're embracing the future with our
          new online ordering system. We hope it brings even more convenience to
          your Bruno's Pizzeria experience.
